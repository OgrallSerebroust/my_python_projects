# This is my most interesting python projects
## What is it?
* ### Lorenz_Attractor is a folder with easy realisation of Lorenz Attractor. In the future it will be a specific core for realisations of beautiful simulations.

* ### main_V2 is a folder with beatiful program for university, it's finished, but can be upgrading. This program is GUI solvder of ∫t²arccos(xt)dt, which show a desigion of it, a step of splitting, a dierences between the solutions of algorithm and analytics, and build a schedule of solutions.
* ### recursion_for_task_in_university is a folder with program which build all existing valid bracket expressions for n entered by the user. This program completed on 80-90%.
